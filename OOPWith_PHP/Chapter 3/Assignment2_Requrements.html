<h1>Assignment 2 Requirements</h1>

<pre>

GENERAL:

- Create a Financial Transaction HTML form that allows a user to...

  - Select either Income or Expense from a select-option list

  - Enter an Item name for the transaction

  - Select one of the following categories from a select-option list...
  	 - Food, Gas, Paycheck, Rent, Stock

  - Enter an Amount for the transaction

  - Click a submit button to add a transaction

- Display a list of the current known transactions
  in a table below the HTML form.


STRUCTURE:

- The IncomeCategories interface defines constants
   to represent the valid categories for Income transactions:  PayCheck, Stock

- The IncomeCategories interface and lists a method definition, checkIncomeCategory,
   that recieves the category as an arguement.

 - The ExpenseCategories interface defines constants
   to represent the valid categories for Expense transactions:  Rent, Food, Gas

 - The ExpenseCategories interface and lists a method definition, checkExpenseCategory,
   that recieves the category as an arguement.

- The Transaction class...

   ... is a the top of the inheritence chain.  It should not be allowed
       to be instatianted by itself.

  ... has the following instance variables:  item, category, and amount

  ... has a  displayTrans() function which reads from the "transfile.txt"
      file and displays the information stored in each line as a row
      in an HTML tables.   The displayTrans() can be called directly
      from the Transaction class

      The transfile.txt file stores a  line of data as a delimited string in the
      following format:  Income/Expense indicator, Item Name, Category, Amount
      e.g (Income*Dividends*Stock*222*)

  ... has a addTrans() function which appends a transaction to the transfile.txt
      file in the delimited string format described above


- The IncomeTran class will...

   ...  inherit the Transaction class

   ...  implement the IncomeCategories interface

   ...  the checkIncomeCategory method will check the Income Category
        selected by the user again the list of valid Income Catories defined
        in the IncomeCategories interface


 - The ExpenseTran class will...

   ...  inherit the Transaction class

   ...  implement the ExpenseCategories interface

   ...  the checkExpenseCategory method will check the Income Category
        selected by the user again the list of valid Expense Catories defined
        in the ExpenseCategories interface



PROCESSING:

- The submit button, when clicked will recursively call the program and
  do the following...

	- Display the HTML form

  	- Determine if this is the first time the HTML form
  	  is displaying for the user to enter data and, if so,
  	  display a list of the current known transactions
  	  in a table below the HTML form and end the processing

  	- If the user has entered data to be processed, do
  	  the following...

  	  ... If the user selected Income as the type of transaction
  	      instantiate an IncomeTran object and check to see
  	      if the Category selected is valid for an Income transaction

  	  ... If the user selected Expense as the type of transaction
  	      instantiate an ExpenseTran object and check to see
  	      if the Category selected is valid for an Expense transaction

  	- If the Category is valid for the Income/Expense type then
  	   add the data as a line in the transfile.txt file.

  	- Otherwise, display an Error Message

    - Display a list of the current known transactions
  	  in a table below the HTML form
